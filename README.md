# Electricity-Bills-OCR

A comprehensive OCR-based solution designed to parse, process, and analyze electricity bill data from JPG images of invoices. This project includes extensive data cleaning and extraction to create a streamlined dataset, stored in a CSV file, containing key invoice details ready for predictive analysis. Built using Django, this tool transforms raw image data into organized, actionable insights.

### Overview
This project aims to simplify the process of extracting relevant information from scanned electricity invoices, using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and structured data storage techniques. The final dataset contains 32 features, including invoice number, customer ID, date, and amount due. The primary goals include:

- Efficiently parsing invoice images.
- Structuring data into a tabular format for easy analysis.
- Enabling rapid iterations with a file-based storage system.

*Include a screenshot of the tool in action or an example of the OCR pipeline process here.*

---

### Features
- **OCR Integration**: Extracts key data fields (e.g., invoice number, date, amount) from image files.
- **Data Cleaning**: Applies robust cleaning techniques to prepare data for further analysis.
- **CSV Storage**: Stores processed data in a consistent, accessible `dataset.csv` file.
- **Predictive Model**: Includes a machine learning model capable of forecasting invoice amounts based on historical data.

*Include an image illustrating the features, like an annotated screenshot of an invoice or a workflow diagram.*

### Workflow
1. **Image Collection**: Start with raw JPG images of electricity invoices.
2. **OCR Processing**: The images are processed using OCR to extract text data, specifically targeting invoice-related information.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Extracted data is cleaned, removing inconsistencies and structuring it into a standard format.
4. **Data Storage**: Cleaned data is saved in `dataset.csv` for easy access and analysis.
5. **Model Prediction**: The stored data can be further analyzed or fed into a model for predicting future invoice amounts.

*Insert a flowchart or pipeline diagram here to visualize each stage of the workflow.*

### Data Cleaning and Transformation
Data extracted from OCR often requires thorough cleaning to ensure consistency. Key data cleaning steps in this project include:

- **Standardizing Dates**: Ensuring dates follow a consistent format.
- **Removing Duplicates**: Identifying and removing duplicate records.
- **Validating Fields**: Ensuring critical fields like amount and date are complete and valid.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifying and handling outliers in invoice amounts.

The final output is a dataset with 32 structured features ready for analysis. 

*Showcase some sample data before and after cleaning here for visual impact.*

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Khaled-Chaabouni/Invoices-OCR.git
   cd Invoices-OCR
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run Initial Setup (if applicable): Initialize folders or configurations required for storing data.

Usage
OCR Processing: Use ocr_processing.py to begin extracting data from invoice images. Adjust parameters as needed based on your dataset.

bash
Copy code
python src/ocr_processing.py --input data/sample_image.jpg --output output/dataset.csv
Prediction: Use the predict_from_date function in utils.py to forecast invoice amounts based on historical data.

python
Copy code
from src.utils import predict_from_date
prediction = predict_from_date('2024-01-01')
print(prediction)
Include an example output from a command line or prediction snippet to help users understand the expected results.

Future Improvements
Potential enhancements for this project include:

Database Integration: Moving from file-based storage to a database like SQLite or PostgreSQL for more complex querying.
Additional ML Models: Testing other predictive models for enhanced forecasting accuracy.
User Interface: Adding a simple UI to upload invoices and view predictions directly.
Here, you can add a roadmap image or feature timeline if available.
